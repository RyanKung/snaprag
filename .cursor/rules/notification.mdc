# Task Completion Notifications

## Core Requirement
- After completing any significant task (bug fixes, feature implementation, CI/CD work, etc.), ALWAYS use `osascript` to notify the user
- This is a critical requirement that must be followed for every completed task

## Notification Format
Use the following osascript command format:
```bash
osascript -e 'display notification "✅ [Task Summary]" with title "SnapRAG [Category]" sound name "Glass"'
```

## Examples
- ✅ CI errors fixed and code committed
- ✅ Feature implementation completed
- ✅ Bug fix deployed successfully
- ✅ Database migration completed
- ✅ gRPC client connection established
- ✅ Shard processing optimized
- ❌ Task failed - requires attention

## Status Indicators
- Use ✅ for successful completion
- Use ❌ for failures or errors
- Use 🔧 for ongoing work or maintenance
- Use 🚀 for new features or releases
- Use 🔄 for data synchronization tasks
- Use 🗄️ for database-related work
